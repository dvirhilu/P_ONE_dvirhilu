'''
SimAnalysis contains helper functions commonly used when writing
scripts to analyze results from simulation sets. Mainly, it allows
to easily decompose geometries into smaller sets by specifying a list
of omkeys, and allows to impose harder cuts on simulations so that different
geometries/cuts could be tried out without running the simulation again.

To import make sure that P_ONE_dvirhilu/src is in PYTHONPATH

# Given twp sets of x,y input data, the function returns a 2D histogram of 
# their ratios. If a division by 0 is bound to happen in the ratio, a value 
# of 0 is assigned to the ratio histogram. Ratio is Hist2D1 / Hist2D2 
# 
# @Param:
# datax1:           First set of x input data
# datay1:           First set of y input data
# datax2:           Second set of x input data
# datay2:           Second set of y input data
# weights1:         weighting applied to the first set of data
# weights2:         weighting applied to the second set of data
# bins:             The bins to histogram the data in. Same possible inputes
#                   as bins setting for matplotlib.pyplot.hist2d  
# 
# @Return: 
# A tuple containing the ratio 2D histogram, xedges, and yedges. Example code 
# for use:
# 
# plt.figure()
# ratioHist, xedges, yedges = makeRatioHist2D(datax1, datay1, datax2, datay2, weights1, weights2, bins)
# pc = plt.pcolor(xedges, yedges, ratioHist, norm = matplotlib.colors.LogNorm())
# plt.colorbar(pc)
