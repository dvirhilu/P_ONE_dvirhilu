# P_ONE_dvirhilu
Simulation and analysis of optimal geometries for Pacific Ocean Neutrino Explorer (P-ONE). P-ONE is a 200 optical module
planned predecessor to a large scale neutrino telescope in the Cascadia Basin. Currently The repository heavily relies on software made by IceCube, a neutrino detector located in the South Pole. The repository does not contain said software, and to run the code in this repository, downloading and building IceCube software is essential. All simulation scripts were run on ComputeCanada's Cedar computing cluster, and therefore all paths in simulation scripts refer to paths in the distributed system. All other scripts were run locally and have paths referencing local directories.
